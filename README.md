This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple Calculator application for demonstration purposes

## Start the app
1. clone the following repo <b>git@github.com:amarfiaz/ama-calc.git</b>
2. cd into <b>ama-calc</b>
3. type <b>npm install</b>
4. type <b>npm start</b>
5. App will open a browser window at <b>http://localhost:3000</b>

## Run units tests
1. cd into <b>ama-calc</b>
2. type <b>npm test</b> to launch the test runner

## Next steps
1. Refactor code and replace use of <b>eval</b> with a more robust alternative
2. Implement a nicer style. Currently it's quite plain, a lot more could be done with the CSS
3. Use specific React test library. e.g. enzyme
